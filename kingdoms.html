                    Overview
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Somewhere in the large sea sits an island amassed with food and animals. There, a kingdom was
                    founded of amphibious men and women, those of which not wanting to stand besides the dragonfolk.
                    This kingdom would be known as Arora, their first leader being an amphibian man who had helped
                    create an enchanted necklace that would make anyone the strongest of their kind, even being able to
                    control water. This necklace would go inside of the wearer becoming one with the owner until they
                    died, only then appearing back onto their neck. Anyone with the necklace was prophesized as a God,
                    being their first leader reincarnated.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Lore
                </h3>
                <p>The kingdom of Arora was created to side step the rules of other kingdoms. Here you aren't just born
                    into a class and stuck there for the rest of your life. Once born in Arora it's as though you're
                    rich, given plentiful amounts of food which some other kingdoms would prove scarce. The creator of
                    Arora wanted a place where his people could be free without being of slave class. Though some may be
                    laborers they get more food than those who do not work as intensely. Soldiers here are taught
                    discipline through starving while to extreme exercises and using a sword.
                    The creator of the kingdom first wanted nothing to do with other kingdoms, however their lack of
                    metals and so on made it hard. Without metals they'd only have armor made of leather and weapons
                    made from sticks and stones, which some do to this day. This is relatively a weaker kingdom, however
                    everyone born here has at least had a month of training with swords and spears, to make up for their
                    lack of materials for the weaponry.
                    Many of their homes are made from wood. Replanting a tree everytime they cut one down to prevent
                    deforestation.

                <p>
                    Arora has had a large amount of Elven-folk come to live with them since the creation of the kingdom,
                    both being seen almost as equals to one another. Of course there were more amphibious folk than on.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To be exact, there are 19,571 people living here.
                </p>

                    Hierarchy
                </h3>
                <p>
                    PA king is chosen, not through bloodline, but intelligence. Those being related to the kings before
                    are treated as nobles. A new king is made through testing those who wish to run for it, however to
                    run for king you must be born in the kingdom. The civilians of which wanted to be king will take
                    tests on whether they can read, write, do simple mathematics, solve economical issues, and what
                    they'd do as their king during a potential war. The choice of getting to be king is given to by the
                    oldest family member of the last king that isn't participating in the tests. If there is no family
                    member of the old king that abides there will be eight amphibian-men, one elf, and one person of a
                    random race that's in the minority to vote on which of the potential kings they want that has passed
                    the tests. Being the reason for an elf and another minority judge being there is to make sure to
                    speak up for their races. A king needs eight or more approvals from the randomly selected judges.

                <p>
                    Arora is known for its food and thread production. With the large population of sheep, wool is the
                    easiest material for clothing to get there. They trade thread to Lyladon for more money to improve
                    their economy.

                    Religion in Arora is a sensitive topic. The biggest religion here is called Lagua, known to spread
                    the good word of Mwura. The people of the church are to donate to the poor at least once a month to
                    make sure to help people they can and give them at least basic living conditions.

                <p>
                    Cempasúchil is a kingdom that focuses on conquering all other kingdoms with the end goal of peace.
                    Believing if everyone falls under one kingdom many wars will be stopped. They reside in the desert
                    making its kingdom full of hardened warriors who value strength and respect. The kingdoms Queen,
                    Lockjaw, is the best example of that with her past of being a gladiator.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The kingdom never lets anything go to waste and will fight until their dying breath making them
                    formidable foes.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Since they've conquered many territories the kingdoms population is a mixing pot but the original
                    occupants were dragons and other desert based races.
                </p>

                </h4>

                <p>
                    The Queen Lockjaw rules, others are welcome to challenge her but it rarely happens and no ones ever
                    won. She maintains order and delegates tasks to trusted individuals
                </p>

                <h4>
                    Society
                </h4>

                <p>
                    Since they started as a smaller desert kingdom there wasn't much of a difference since everyone was
                    more focused on surviving. That kept up due to the queen's insistence, something about following a
                    dream. So the only difference is what each person gathers themselves since it also reflects their
                    strength.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The people value strength since they're kingdom and queen were built off of it. Strength to survive
                    the desert, to stop a war, to win a war and so on. So strength and how one uses it are the people's
                    values. They also value respect and the dead, believing they're past loved ones deserve respect and
                    that everything deserves at least basic respect as another being. This came about due to the
                    grueling desert life, they had to value everything they had and respect how things work, to the
                    smallest desert mouse to the largest monster. The desert took many lives in harsh ways so the people
                    valued and honored them.

                <p>
                    In a place with little to celebrate, it's people find every reason to celebrate
                </p>

                <p>
                    They celebrate life, death and even just making it through seasons because in the desert sometimes
                    the only thing you have is hope and will. They do well in maintaining that and appreciating what
                    they have.
                </p>

                <p>
                    As a result of the many celebrations all Cempasúchil citizens have some idea about how to dance,
                    from ballroom to their own traditional and fun dances.

                    Its hard to earn the ire of its people. Hate isn't natural for them despite the constant wars but
                    there are exceptions. Wastefulness is an easy way to earn the people of Cempasúchil's hatred

                <p>
                    The kingdom thrives on war, trained from childhood(disguised as games for children) for battle. The
                    kingdom is more than capable of defending itself and even then they desert, it's monsters and
                    cruelty acts as a defense in itself.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Once a group of people born around the same time reach adulthood they are sent off for a month to
                    survive in the desert on their own. To prove they can survive, to show strength and to harden them
                    against it so if they ever need to fight there they can.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Kingdom has an artifact that was originally in the hands of another kingdom they conquered that
                    was made by the goddess of peace. The artifact was intended for peace negotiations and diplomacy. It
                    creates a large forcefield, anyone outside cannot enter and anyone inside is unable to use magic.
                    Within the forcefield its a beautiful vision of the ocean. Lockjaw saw the artifact as an
                    opportunity and used it to win many battles. The kingdom still uses it but its a well kept secret.

                    State of affairs
                </h3>

                <p>
                    Sometimes there are issues with assimilating conquered kingdoms to the culture but usually they are
                    allowed to keep a majority of their original traditions and religions. They just have to follow the
                    orders from the capital. The queen regularly makes rounds to all the other territories and has
                    informants to ensure everything runs smoothly.

                    (How does your kingdom interact with others? At least what does it think of them? See the lore
                    channels for information on the other kingdoms, or even ask their creators how they think your two
                    kingdoms would interact.)
                </p>

                <p>
                    Foreign Relations aren't the best since Cempasúchil is more focused on conquering other kingdoms.
                    While still able to trade goods and services tensions are high and everything is done with caution.
                    They have one official allegiance with Skeleng.

                <p>
                    The Kingdom just at its base is known for mercenary work and getting rid of monsters for other
                    kingdoms since they're used to much harder monsters. Now they also have various trades from other
                    territories they've conquered.
                </p>

                <p>
                    They do have their own livestock but don't really trade them since they were bred specifically for
                    the desert and to help the kingdom when it was struggling most. They do import food and water during
                    harsher seasons but it's rare they want to depend on others.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Cempasúchil has perfected the art of using all that's available To them. They've cultivated unique
                    healing spices, its something unique to them and maximizes utility, reduces waste and avoids having
                    to dedicate extra resources to extra farms. It also made the plants more hardy within the desert but
                    hard to grow the specific type outside of the unforgiving desert.
                </p>

                <p>
                    They use these spices/seasonings in their food a lot so they have many delicacies.

                    the assassanation of a single ruler. There can only be twelve rulers at a time, all of which control
                    different parts of the military and kingdom.

                    People here are extremely docile despite being run by the military. They worship the Gods all day
                    when they aren't working, they siphon Gold from their land to trade gold to other kingdoms due to
                    the large quantity of it they have. These people essentially live in luxury and live on a trading
                    system instead of an endless pursuit of supply and demand. The people train for the Gods, work for
                    the Gods, etc. The populace is held together by religion and the military that promises to protect
                    them. They eat scorpions, cacti, bread, fish, fruit, and vegetables regularly. Despite their lack of
                    fertile land they make the best of it, still studying agriculture. They also aren't a fan of
                    outsiders

                    This kingdom is mostly desert, however their military works well with the limited resources they
                    have. What they lack in wood and essential materials they gain back in minerals like gold and iron.
                    By far one of the richest countries when talking about pure gold. Using the materials they have they
                    can make weapons and they train themselves for protection.

                    A lot of the kingdom is desert and what isn't desert is safari. Their area is extremely hot causing
                    them to usually wear either long clothing to protect them from the sun or almost no clothing in an

                    The Empire was created by the Reeves' bloodline during a long forgotten war between Demi-Humans
                    and
                    Humanity, while the war was not won, they were able to hold a large patch of land and created an
                    empire that
                    thrived off magical use, the land around overflowing with arcane resources.

                    The Marsh Confederacy is a diverse swamp kingdom full of tribes governing themselves for the most
                    part. It faces
                    challenges like internal strife, external threats, and environmental degradation. Despite these, the

                    governance, diverse cultures, ancient magic, and a safe haven for lawlessness.
                </p>

                <h3>
                    History
                </h3>

                <p>
                    Among the first beings to inhabit the great swamp since the beginning of the world, the ogres rose
                    to
                    prominence. A particularly cunning and powerful ogre named Throngle united the various clans,
                    establishing a
                    loose rule of law. Under his reign, the swamp flourished. Trade routes were established, alliances
                    forged, and a
                    rich culture developed. The Whispering Woods, a place of ancient magic, and the Druid's Circle, a
                    sacred site
                    for nature worship, became symbols of the kingdom's prosperity.
                </p>

                <p>
                    However, a great war erupted, tearing the Confederacy apart. Powerful factions, driven by greed and
                    ambition,
                    battled for control of the swamp's resources. The war left the land scarred and the people divided.
                    The
                    once-mighty ogre clans fragmented, and many were driven to the brink of extinction. The Blighted
                    Moors, a toxic
                    wasteland, became a stark reminder of the war's destructive power. Dark forces, such as necromancers
                    and demon
                    summoners, emerged from the shadows, seeking to exploit the weakened Confederacy.
                </p>

                <p>
                    For centuries, the swamp was plunged into a dark age. The once-thriving cities and villages fell
                    into ruin. The
                    Great Market, once a bustling hub of trade, became a den of thieves and outlaws. The Ogre Citadel, a
                    symbol of
                    power and unity, was reduced to rubble. The Whispering Woods grew silent, and the Druid's Circle was
                    desecrated.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In recent times, a glimmer of hope emerged from the darkness. A new generation of leaders, inspired
                    by the
                    legends of the past, rose to challenge the forces of chaos and despair. They rallied the scattered
                    clans,
                    rebuilt the shattered infrastructure, and rekindled the spirit of the Swamp.
                </p>

                    The Great Market was reclaimed and turned into The Goblin Market, a place of offerings so vast it's
                    known around
                    the world. The Ogre Citadel was rebuilt, but still remains a shadow of its former self. The
                    Whispering Woods
                    once again echoed with the whispers of ancient spirits, and the Druid's Circle was consecrated anew.
                    As for the
                    Blighted Moor, well, who knows if all the various hexes and chemicals can ever be cleaned of the
                    place some
                    still try, but many have died even attempting to do so.

                    The Marsh Confederacy is now a shadow of its former self, but it is a resilient shadow. Its people
                    are
                    determined to rebuild their civilization and restore the swamp to its former glory.

                <p>
                    The Marsh Confederacy doesn't exactly have a central government, rather each area is extremely
                    autonomous, and
                    has its own rules and norms, as the land is extremely diverse. However, in times of unrest or
                    threats to the
                    nation, the tribal leaders of the Confederacy can call together a grand council made up of 3
                    representatives of
                    each tribe to make decisions that affect all of them. These grand councils are held in a tribal hall
                    in the
                    center of the land, and presided over by an ogre named Lord Kerhs whose position is more respected
                    than
                    enforced.

                </h4>

                <p>
                    The Marsh Confederacy is a diverse and interconnected society, each tribe within it possesses unique
                    cultural
                    nuances, traditions, and social structures. These differences create a tapestry of cultures within
                    the swamp,
                    leading to a vibrant and dynamic social ecosystem.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Some tribes prioritize agriculture, cultivating nutrient-rich swamp plants for sustenance. Others
                    specialize in
                    hunting, fishing, or gathering, relying on the swamp's abundant resources. Some tribes have a strong
                    affinity
                    for magic, with shamans and sorcerers playing pivotal roles in their communities.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Societal structures vary as well. Some tribes are matriarchal, with women holding positions of power
                    and
                    influence. Others are patriarchal, with men leading the way. Some tribes are even egalitarian, with
                    power shared
                    among all members. A few tribes are quite discriminatory though, only allowing certain races to live
                    there, and
                    some are of the opposite extreme, seedy tribes rife with people wanted by other kingdoms, who
                    disappeared into
                    the relatively lawless Swamp Confederacy.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Without a strong central authority though, power struggles happen from time to time. A blind eye is
                    often turned
                    to inner-tribe conflicts and sometimes even inter-tribe conflict can be ignored if they don't pose a
                    big threat
                    to the surrounding areas.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Despite these differences, most of the tribes come together from time to time to celebrate shared
                    festivals and
                    exchange goods. And when it comes time for a grand council, almost all cooperate on matters of
                    mutual concern.

                <p>
                    When the need arises, the grand council forms a militia to respond to threats, composed of
                    volunteers from the
                    various tribes. These militias are often varied and change depending on the type of threat or enemy
                    faced, but
                    can often be weak and ill equipped compared to the surrounding modern kingdoms.

                <h3>
                    State of affairs
                </h3>

                <p>
                    The Confederacy faces both internal and external challenges. Internal conflicts between tribes can
                    arise due to
                    resource scarcity, ancient grudges, or ideological differences. External threats, such as invading
                    armies or
                    powerful magic users, can also pose a significant danger to the swamp.
                </p>

                <p>
                    To address these challenges, the Confederacy convenes Grand Councils as needed. These councils bring
                    together
                    representatives from various tribes to discuss matters of common concern, such as defense, trade,
                    and resource
                    allocation. Lord Kerhs, though not a dictator, plays a crucial role in guiding these discussions and
                    ensuring
                    fairness.

                    penetrate into the shallow swamp waters though, so it is a risk mostly kept away. The citizens of
                    the Swamp
                    mostly view them with distrust regardless, wary of their potential to crack down on the seedier
                    parts of the
                    Confederacy and threaten its sovereignty.

                    Lore
                </h3>

                <p>
                    Necria is one of the oldest kingdoms, and yet- One with the least amount of history. The main castle
                    which houses its royalty was one rebuilt from the rubble of an unknown, lost civilization.
                    Historians cannot agree what ended these people, and it is thus a matter of contention. While traces
                    of who lived there last are up for speculation, there was a notable excess of evidence of mass
                    burial grounds. Corpses in such states even mages and scholars from overseas could not make heads
                    nor tails of it. These unexplainable traces left an impact on the environment around them. Their
                    flora and fauna grow in colors like swirling oil spills, tainted by this ancient magic. Crops grown
                    from their soil spoiled, and had strange tastes- Forcing them to export much of their food and
                    livestock. Even the sunsets have a reddish glow, as if reflecting the blood spilt on their grounds.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Their Kingdom had an uphill battle making sure it could survive and help its people at the same
                    time. The Nexus' were the first and only line of Royals, originally elected and then sworn in by
                    blood. Their reputation was that of a strong but strict family, and for hundreds of years they
                    slowly but steadily grew and expanded.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The early settlers suffered through food shortages, aggressive animals and a new disease which
                    seemed to attack mostly mages. Consumption of tainted meat and crops also led to sickness, of which
                    there was no cure. All the royals could do was offer whatever they could to manage symptoms, and try
                    to dissuade people from eating from the land.
                </p>

                <p>
                    As it turned out, their curious environment did not offer all sickness and rot. Their mines ended up
                    elevating their trade when they discovered new, extremely durable metals- Which not only rivaled the
                    sturdiest known armors, but were incredibly attuned to magic, making enchanting easy and more
                    effective. It was a life-changing discovery, one that altered the course of their history.
                </p>

                <p>
                    What had once been a close-knit but sturdy and small territory underwent rapid expansion. Their
                    borders grew, as did their economy and the effectiveness of their militias. This led to the first of
                    many border skirmishes to another growing territory to their right- The Xeo Dynasty. Fighting which
                    only ended on a tense, bloody line drawn down the middle of their land. Necria had only pushed so
                    far due to want for fertile lands and access to untainted areas, and was only stopped when the
                    fighting was causing such stress to their economy and trade their people were suffering needlessly.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The King, blinded by legacy, seeing how they couldn't be beaten back into their own territory due
                    to its unnatural conditions and the rot in the smog- Pushed on still, which proved to trigger his
                    demise.
                </p>

                <p>
                    It was the death of the King that brought this chapter to a close, as his daughter Althea rose to
                    the mantle and decided on the diplomatic route. The newly crowned Queen began her reign by ending
                    the bloody battles in the fissures, and ushering in an era of invention and progress.

                    creatures and proclivities are also prevalent. They have a surprisingly high birth rate for mages
                    even among non-magical lineages, causing some to believe it is the location itself that is closer
                    than normal to these unseen forces. However, with an increase in magical prowess, an incurable
                    disease of unknown magical origin also plagues the land. While not common, anymore at least- And
                    ranging in severity and symptoms, the most notable sign of this taint is a visible mark, often
                    called crystal rot due to its appearance and tendency to spread out like opalescent spiderwebs.

                    it. They can also offer advice to the council and in turn the Queen.

                <p>
                    Relying heavily on trade due to their inability to grow their own food or raise their own livestock,
                    they have a very successful business exporting metals, weapons and ore to neighboring nations.

                <p>
                    Necria has been a heavily militia-focused Kingdom since the discovery of their mines, and as such
                    their weaponry and training reflects this. They have their own unique organizational efforts, and do
                    not discriminate on race, gender, or even illness. In fact, those infected with crystal rot are
                    often used in the fissures due to their resilience to the smog.

                </h3>

                <p>
                    Necria has a melting pot of different species and religions, but their emphasis on community luckily
                    prevents any major rifts from forming. If there was one thing about shared struggle, it was that it
                    would make or break a group of people. There is a disparity- Between laborers and people working
                    closer to the castle, but under Althea's rule this gap is slowly closing. Benefits to miners also
                    improved under her, though access to medical treatment has always been a promise the family has
                    upheld.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Aside from community, they have a surprising emphasis on providing adequate training to anyone
                    able-bodied- And are not stingy in providing weapons to their own people above others. While lacking
                    any real agricultural products, mining is the most widespread job for the working class, as well as
                    jobs involving textiles. They've also found success in producing certain types of fabrics from
                    silk-worms only present in their rich cave systems.

                    Great plateaus of rotted, cobbled stone and earth sprout up from the ground like flat-topped fungi,
                    ranging in size but reaching ~80 ft. The ravines that flow beneath are often overrun with a sort of
                    smog, which is still up for debate on origin, even by specialists. Some believe it to rise from the
                    earth during certain seasons or changes, while others believe its root lies in spores blooming.
                    Whatever the cause, it can lead to hallucinations and out of body experiences if inhaled enough, and
                    some people believe it causes crystal rot. Curiously, those already infected with this rot show a
                    surprising resilience to this smogs effects. Travel in these areas is frowned upon, though some use
                    the ravines to measure their progress from a distance. Deepstalker's use these areas to raise
                    their young in certain seasons- The territorial predators another deterrent to the area.

                    Huge, mutated plants make up the majority of Necria's forests. It sports one of the tallest trees
                    in the world, and much of its fauna has either evolved some sort of defensive or evolutionary tactic
                    for survival- Or has simply tripled in size. Home to many of Necria's animals, the flora also
                    poses risk- As some of them have mutated and developed a taste for meat.

                    The most dangerous but also most lucrative area in Necria, the mines and caverns that run below its
                    surface run for miles beneath the equally strange topside. Many are uncharted, despite their great
                    efforts to maximize miners' safety and presence. They have decided the Zylothe's, a primitive
                    species found in its depths- Are not to be trifled with over territories, and thus certain cave
                    systems are left alone.

                    Region Description: Solaris is a combination of high, snow-capped mountains, fertile meadows and
                    fields, and a large forest, always stuck in the Season of Autumn. Civilization is rampant in

                    find caverns which are heavily fortified due to the terrifying spider folk of Notoriety - however,
                    these cave entrances span across the entirety of Solaris, thus putting it in a constant war with the
                    Darkness. The Government has evolved to deal with their presence, and due to the unification of the
                    people, there are countless tales of heroes who risked their lives to defeat the Threat, and deliver
                    the light unto the aptly named “Cavern-Dwellers”. The people are all devoted to a religion centered
                    around the light, and you can find a Church devoted to Seraphiel, the God of Light, in every town.

                    HISTORY
                </h3>

                <p>
                    Founding Date: 1st Year of the Dawn, Spanning 500 years ago. Created on March 20th. (Spring Equinox,
                    where the Sun is said to shine the brightest)
                </p>

                <h4>
                    Founders/Legends:
                </h4>

                <p>
                    Story One - Seraphiel and the Lords: The Kingdom of Solaris was, at one point, a collection of
                    tribes spread out across the Mainland. They were in constant conflict with one another, and many
                    died to famine due to sabotage and destruction of one another. One Man, King Seraphiel, was born
                    with a direct connection to the Divine Light. He healed the land, originally torn apart from each
                    tribe's endless conflict, and combatted famine by instantly growing crops with his touch. His power
                    was so great, it was said that any Man who stood against him would be incinerated in an instant.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Tales rose of his Angelic Nature - people believed the Gods had sent one of their own to bring Peace
                    and Prosperity to the Chaos that was early Solaris. Some even believed that with a single touch,
                    Seraphiel could heal any ailment, even bringing sight to the blind, or restoring lost limbs.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Seraphiel was said to have come from the Heavens themselves, and a divine glow followed him wherever
                    he stood. That's why, in the span of only a month, the Country had been united behind one Front -
                    Solaris; which simply meant “The Light”, symbolizing both Harmony and Hope. The Greatest Men and
                    Women banded together to create the City of Luminara, a place in the heart of the Mainland. It was
                    protected by the Mountains to the North, and it was fueled by the Farmlands to the South and East,
                    while it also had a strong connection to trade routes by the Sea.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Temples dedicated to Seraphiel and the Light were created everywhere, in both Cities and Villages.
                    They worshipped the light; the purity, harmony, and hope that it brought with it. Because of their
                    intense beliefs, a type of magic began to pervade the very hearts of the People of Solaris, and
                    those with the strongest moral compasses began to grow angelic wings and be able to heal just like
                    Seraphiel.
                </p>

                <p>
                    However, not all was perfect. The Lords of Each tribe became jealous and terrified of the Angel's
                    power, so they banded together to bring his ruin. Numerous attempts were made against Seraphiel's
                    life, but none of them succeeded; poison didn't seem to work, and the strongest warriors didn't hold
                    a candle to the power of Seraphiel. With all of their attempts, the Lords found one of his
                    weaknesses - in the dead of night, Seraphiel weakened just enough for their strongest ritual to
                    stand a chance.
                </p>

                <p>
                    They lured Seraphiel deep into the Autumnfall Woods, and locked him inside of a temple with a
                    powerful ritual. The Angel fought back, his power coursing through the very land itself, and locking
                    the woods in an eternal Twilight. However, he could not escape. Not in time for the ritual to
                    succeed, putting Seraphiel in an eternal coma, locked away in his chamber. The Lords claimed his
                    power, but remained dedicated to the Light, understanding the unification that came with it. The
                    people simply believed Seraphiel had ascended to the Heavens, the truth lost to history forever.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Now, it's said that the Autumnfall Woods hold a secret. That the veil between life and death is
                    weakened in the woods, and that no one should enter if they wish to keep their lives. The forest
                    lies on the Eastern Border between Solaris and Other Countries, and travelling by boat to Solaris's
                    Eastern Coast is not recommended, nor trying to pass through the forest.
                </p>

                <h4>
                    Story 2 - The Fall of Emberline Keep (Year of the Dawn 151 -> Present Day 300 YD):
                </h4>

                <p>
                    One hundred and forty years passed since the action of the Leaders, and the Kingdom fell into deeply
                    split factions (tribes, but civilized) once again. Some believed that Seraphiel had been betrayed,
                    others believed that he abandoned them, and they should abandon the light itself. One thing was for
                    certain - Solaris had changed from light to twilight.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In those two millenia, magic had been developed. Militia had been formed, and technology was created
                    - after all, Solaris prided itself on Military Strength to protect from other Countries, if the need
                    ever came. Which, unfortunately it did.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Dawn Bringers, a legacy spanning from the last of Seraphiel's blessed militia, tried their damndest
                    to unite the factions again. They created an Order of The Light, and put into place a Constitution,
                    describing the problems of each faction and the solutions to each one. This Constitution was
                    immediately respected and put into place, as it offered a reprieve from the horrific faction crimes
                    that took place nearly every week. The People knew they needed a change, and The Order provided
                    that.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Lords compromised with The Order, and everyone elected an Emperor - someone with everyone's best
                    choice in mind. The elected official was both extremely strong; reminiscing the old Lord Seraphiel,
                    and wise, which allowed him to lead responsibly. With both Religion and Military agreeing on this
                    form of Government, no issues came with the decision. Emperor Constantine enacted repairs, drafted
                    laws, and followed the words of the Council (the unification of the old Lords and the Order). One of
                    Constantine's most impressive feats was the establishment of “Emberline Keep” - a bastion against
                    the other Countries across the Ocean, standing just on the edge of Autumnfall Woods. Mass mining
                    expeditions to the west began.
                </p>

                <p>
                    A couple of years into the Rule by Constantine came a plight. Women, Children, and Warriors from a
                    village on the West coast, tens of miles outside of Luminara were going missing; a village near the
                    mines - the Lords thought it due to disease, but with their rapidly advanced technologies and
                    magical plants, Constantine thought it unlikely. Dozens of Scouts (named “Dawnstriders”) were sent
                    to the village, and only one made it back; yet barely, as the man was missing an arm and was very
                    quickly on the verge of death. They had awakened something.
                </p>

                <p>
                    His dying words were “The Mines” - before the poor man collapsed onto the ground from his horse,
                    losing his life from the blood loss.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The reaction was intense. An entire militia was sent to the Caverns of Sunfall, with the Emperor
                    joining them, guiding them through the Autumnfall Woods. There, after several day's travel, they
                    witnessed firsthand the horrors of the Underdark; Notoriety, it was called, and it was an entire
                    population of Spider People. Notoriety's soldiers had enhanced strength, could weave powerful silk,
                    and had powerful enchanted weapons.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Soldiers and the spider folk fought a close battle, but it was clear Notoriety was pushing them
                    back. In the night, where the power of the mages and the soldiers were at its lowest, Spiders
                    attacked, burning the camp and pushing the remaining soldiers to retreat back to Emberline Keep.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Emberline Keep held the forces of Notoriety off for weeks, new technology quickly being developed in
                    Lunaris and sent by cart to the bastion. However, the spiders discovered a weakness in their
                    defenses - the caves spanned all over the Mainland, and they didn't need to attack from one side.
                    They emerged from behind Emberline Keep, keeping it in a siege and slaughtering the merchants.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Eventually, they made their way into the keep, murdering every human soldier except for Emperor
                    Constantine, who made a final stand in his chambers. Channeling every force of magic into a
                    self-destructing attack, a mighty explosion shook the land for miles around, collapsing the caverns
                    and serving as a warning to Luminara, but sacrificing himself to do so. Every Spider Soldier was
                    obliterated, pushing back their impending invasion by several weeks, and giving the Capital time to
                    prepare.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The entirety of the Kingdom - the Order, the Old Lords, and the thousands of civilians all held a
                    funeral for him on that day, mourning him collectively. His sacrifice continued their unity, and the
                    first of the Lightbane Legacy was elected on that day; Emperor Michael Lightbane, who was the
                    distant relative of Constantine.
                </p>

                    Constantine is still talked about today - aptly named “The Last Bastion”, due to his noble
                    sacrifice, resulting in a better understanding of Notoriety Forces and specifically designed
                    technology to incinerate their webs. Other methods, such as poisoning them through a neurotoxin that
                    activates posthumously, leaving no way for the poison to be detected, have been developed.
                </p>

                <p>
                    As a result of the sacrifice, the Constantine Academy of Magic and Swordsmanship (CAMS) was
                    established in Luminara, Y.D 155, which provided each person with impressively powerful magic, and
                    knowledge of the weaknesses of the spiders. These CAMS students and warriors act as a bastion of
                    defense, protecting the innocent and vulnerable from the terrible influence of the Spider Folk. The
                    Academy has grown even stronger in 150 years, and is more than sufficient at keeping back the Spider
                    Folk from their cities and Villages - but the Spiders are researching new technologies as well,
                    resulting in an eternal war between the forces of Light and Dark.

                </h3>

                <p>
                    Terrain: Solaris is mostly a plains-based region with some notable variances, being the Enchanted
                    Forest in the West, the Mountains in the North and West ( some Mines as well), and the farmlands in
                    the South. The Kingdom is quite new compared to other civilizations, though they give off a
                    historical vibe with large statues, ruined fortifications, and stone roads which were laid 300 years
                    ago.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Resources: Wood, fertile land, magical crystals, ores, plenty of food, fish, stone, crops (cotton,
                    tobacco), paper. Biggest Export is food and technology, with magical crystals being heavily
                    controlled and defended.

                <p>
                    Borders: Spider Folk (main) territory to the West, Neighboring Kingdom to the North, and a Kingdom
                    across a large River to the South.

                    Monarch's Role: Decision Making, Military Protection.
                </h4>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The Monarch protects the Nation from outside threats or inside rebellions and often fights on
                        the front lines. In times where decisive action is necessary, the Monarch is expected to make
                        strategically sound decisions, informed by the Council.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        The Council presents ideas to the Monarch, and he will either accept or deny them. If at least
                        75% of the Council disagree with his decision, it is overruled.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        For Routine or Minor issues, Trusted Council Members / The Chancellor will make the decision
                        instead.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        During Emergencies, the Monarch can make quick decisions, allowing for quick and efficient
                        decision-making. However, this has a time limit of one week (with voted extensions), and the
                        council must have a post-crisis review of the decisions made.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        The Monarch's Legacy (Merit-Based) is reviewed by The Council, who will determine if the
                        up-and-coming Monarch is good enough to take the Throne. The People also have a say; if they are
                        widely liked, the Council is to be more lenient on their decisions. If the Candidate is not good
                        enough, they won't be selected. Structured Public Debates and Competency Evaluations are held,
                        ensuring the Monarch is the best possible fit.

                    <li>
                        The Council is composed of elected members from the people (term limit of three years, or

                        five different sections. War, Academics, Technology and Construction, Religion, and
                        International Relations. Each has a part to play, and each must do their job well.
                        Sub-committees have also been created, such as “Warfare technologies”, which allow for
                        compromise between different divisions.

                    <li>

                    <li>
                        The Council holds meetings in which they vote on different subjects, ultimately deciding what
                        laws are put into place, or what actions are taken on a more collective level. Such as
                        implementing taxes, food stamps, homeless shelters, etc.

                        Specialized Task Forces composed of representatives from each branch work together to plan

                        are promoted, while smaller units of soldiers will be rotated between each branch to promote an

                    Twilight District (District of Personal Freedom) - A sort of “Red Light District”, where people have
                    more freedom, though unnecessary violence is heavily discouraged and will result in banishment. Was
                    actually created by the People, not by the Government, but remains one of the largest districts for
                    mercenaries, assassins, and other sketchy jobs to find work. It is not uncommon to find Government
                    Agents here, as the district is constantly under watch. Due to its morally Grey nature, it is called
                    The Twilight District - a time between Night and Day. You can purchase more rare items from a
                    heavily regulated Black Market
                </p>

                <p>
                    To promote unity, the district holds small festivals available to everyone once a week, where they
                    spread culture and tell stories. if criminals wish to move to other professions, there is a program
                    that allows it.

                    Noble District - The cleanest and most beautiful district, but mostly open to everyone. This is the
                    Home District of the Constantine Academy, and holds many Noble houses. It places emphasis on
                    knowledge, allowing people from all backgrounds to learn about the World around them. There are
                    several libraries, and even a large colosseum for battle-themed events. Important knowledge is taken
                    from these libraries and placed in a massively fortified library.
                </p>

                <p>
                    There are public gardens and forums so that the District is open to everyone, not just the Nobles.

                    The information is shared with the public in closely watched events every week (Wednesdays) so that

                    The Noble District has a scholarship system for those from other districts who might not have as

                    Another note is the magical wards and alarms present in both the Academy, Noble Houses and the
                    Library, adding another layer of defense. The defenses are discreet and hidden, making stealthy

                <p>
                    The land of Tarus is mostly empty, most of the people live in the capital of Tarus. Tarus city is
                    the home of
                    the actual kingdom, the home of the feared dragon king, Sylus. It's a trading city, filled with
                    gold, silver,
                    jewels, weapons, and the best resource of all information.

                    They happily live under the rule of Sylus, he lets them live free and protects them from those who
                    want to harm
                    them.

                <p>
                    Tarus used to be a land of nothing but Dragons, they all lived in harmony. But where soon hunted to
                    extinction
                    except for Sylus, Sylus is the sole survivor of the Tarus dragons. He made the kingdom in honor of
                    his fallen
                    friends and family. He made it a safe space for the non-dragon people of his kingdom, he'll make
                    it paradise
                    for all those who live there.

                <p>
                    Tarus, for the most part, is a dry and hot land. The kingdom itself is surrounded by a lake of red
                    lava known as
                    The Void. The only way to enter the kingdom is through a natural land bridge formed from obsidian.
                    Sylus'
                    castle is also formed and carved from obsidian and black stone. The capital is surrounded by jagged
                    rocks that
                    form volcanoes and small lava streams.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Just outside the jagged peaks are where the farmers live, taking advantage of the small amount of
                    greenery that
                    is found.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Farther outside of the capital are rolling hills of red flowers and green as far as the eyes can
                    see. Most of
                    the people from Tarus do not visit these places due to the sacred nature as the land is covered with
                    the remains
                    of dragons long past. You'll sometimes see Sylus sitting in the fields of flowers, staring at the
                    oasis below
                    where all the creatures come for water.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The beaches that surround the island are covered in black sand, stained from the ashes of the
                    volcanoes that
                    have scorched the land in the past.

                    of trade
                    deals with other kingdoms due to his high valued riches that are found naturally in his kingdom's

                    Overview
                </h3>

                <p>
                    The Thalassans are a powerful maritime civilization, divided into two subraces; the technologically
                    adept
                    Mechanikoi and the magically inclined Thaumaturgoi. United by their island home, powered by the
                    mystical Dynamis
                    Lake, they dominate the seas with their advanced fleets. Their society is meritocratic, valuing
                    skill over
                    birthright. However, beneath their united front, internal tensions and external conflicts threaten
                    their
                    dominance.
                </p>

                <p>
                    It's important to note that while the High Council holds ultimate authority, the actual power
                    dynamics are often
                    more fluid. The most skilled and influential individuals, regardless of their subrace, can rise to
                    positions of
                    great power and influence. This ensures that the Thalassans remain adaptable and responsive to the
                    ever-changing
                    challenges they face.

                    Governance
                </h3>

                <p>
                    The Thalassan leadership structure is a complex interplay of meritocracy and tradition. Power is
                    distributed
                    among three lower councils, and one ultimate council.

                    Thalassia,
                    and makes the final decisions if there is a large amount of public disagreement with the decisions
                    of any of the
                    other three councils.

                    Society
                </h3>

                <p>
                    Thalassan culture is deeply rooted in the principles of individual achievement, fairness, and
                    progress. It
                    fosters a society where personal growth is paramount, encouraging each individual to strive for
                    excellence and
                    push their limits. Skill development is highly valued, with ample opportunities for education and
                    training
                    available to all. The Thalassans believe in recognizing and rewarding talent, establishing a system
                    that
                    celebrates hard work, creativity, and innovation. Fairness and equality of opportunity are
                    cornerstones of their
                    society, ensuring a level playing field where everyone, regardless of background or social status,
                    has the
                    chance to succeed. Impartial judgment is upheld, with decisions based on merit rather than personal
                    connections
                    or biases. Open competition is encouraged, creating an environment where the best and brightest
                    naturally rise
                    to the top.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Innovation and progress are vital to the Thalassan way of life. They cultivate a culture that values
                    creativity
                    and original thinking, encouraging the exploration of new ideas. Risk-taking is embraced, with a
                    willingness to
                    experiment and try new things. Adaptability is essential, as the Thalassans believe in learning from
                    mistakes
                    and adjusting to changing circumstances. Collaboration and teamwork are also highly prized,
                    emphasizing shared
                    goals and the importance of collective achievement. They respect diversity, recognizing the value of
                    different
                    perspectives and experiences. A strong work ethic permeates their society, characterized by
                    dedication,
                    perseverance, and a commitment to seeing tasks through to completion. Efficient time management and
                    self-discipline are also essential qualities, enabling individuals to prioritize tasks and stay
                    focused.

                    While the meritocratic Thalassan society offers numerous benefits, it also presents certain
                    drawbacks. An
                    overemphasis on competition can foster a cutthroat culture, potentially leading to selfishness and a
                    lack of
                    empathy. The constant pressure to succeed may result in burnout and mental health issues, such as
                    stress,
                    anxiety, and depression. Furthermore, an excessive focus on achievement and success can lead to a
                    neglect of
                    other important values, such as compassion, creativity, and community. Many individuals within the
                    society
                    struggle to maintain a healthy work-life balance, as the pursuit of success often consumes their
                    lives. Finally,
                    the cultural differences between groups such as the Thaumaturgoi and the Mechanikoi can lead to
                    conflicts and
                    misunderstandings, as their unique values and traditions may clash.

                    The Emergence and Division of the Thalassans
                </h4>

                <p>
                    Millennia ago, the Thalassans emerged from the ocean's depths, a people uniquely adapted to the
                    marine
                    environment. Their bodies, shaped by the sea, granted them an innate understanding of its secrets.
                    As their
                    civilization began to flourish, a natural divergence occurred. Some Thalassans, drawn to the
                    tangible and the
                    practical, began to master the use of natural resources and engineering, becoming the Mechanikoi.
                    Others, more
                    attuned to the ethereal and the mystical, delved into the arcane arts, becoming the Thaumaturgoi.
                    This division,
                    though significant, did not fracture their shared heritage. Instead, it created two complementary
                    paths, both
                    dedicated to the protection and expansion of their island home.
                </p>

                <h4>
                    The Foundation of a Meritocratic Kingdom and the Shaping of Thalassia
                </h4>

                <p>
                    Despite their differing disciplines, the Mechanikoi and Thaumaturgoi remained united by a common
                    purpose: to
                    forge a powerful kingdom and extend their influence across the seas. They established a meritocratic
                    society, a
                    system where power and prestige were earned through skill, knowledge, and unwavering loyalty,
                    irrespective of
                    subrace. This foundation of meritocracy became the bedrock of their kingdom, ensuring that the most
                    capable
                    individuals led, regardless of their origin. The island of Thalassia itself became a testament to
                    their combined
                    ingenuity. The Mechanikoi constructed intricate networks of canals and waterways, connecting the
                    island's cities
                    and facilitating trade, while the Thaumaturgoi imbued the land with magic, creating lush, fertile
                    fields and
                    protecting it from harm.

                    Lake Dynamis: A Nexus of Power and Cooperation
                </h4>

                <p>
                    At the heart of Thalassia lay Lake Dynamis, a unique meeting point of magic and technology. For the
                    Thaumaturgoi, the lake served as a sacred sanctuary, its serene waters and mystical energy providing
                    the perfect
                    environment for meditation, spiritual practices, and arcane rituals. They drew power directly from
                    the lake,
                    using it to fuel their spells and enchantments, and believed that certain areas of its depths served
                    as portals
                    to otherworldly realms. For the Mechanikoi, the lake held more practical significance. Its elevated
                    position and
                    the rivers flowing to the coast provided a source of hydropower, driving waterwheels and watermills
                    that powered
                    their shipyards and other industries. Its strategic location made it an ideal hub for shipbuilding
                    and maritime
                    trade, and its unique ecosystem provided ample opportunities for scientific research. By combining
                    the mystical
                    and the practical, Lake Dynamis became a vital resource for both subraces, fostering cooperation and
                    understanding, and ensuring the continued prosperity of the Thalassan civilization.

                    The Rise of Naval Dominance
                </h4>

                <p>
                    The Thalassans' rise to naval dominance was a gradual process, built upon centuries of maritime
                    tradition and
                    strategic innovation. Their deep-rooted seafaring heritage provided them with unparalleled skills in
                    navigation,
                    shipbuilding, and naval tactics. The Thaumaturgoi further enhanced their naval capabilities by
                    imbuing ships
                    with powerful arcane magic, increasing their speed, maneuverability, and defensive strength.
                    Simultaneously, the
                    Mechanikoi, through their ingenious engineering, designed and constructed formidable vessels
                    equipped with
                    advanced sailing techniques and innovative weaponry. A unified naval command ensured efficient
                    coordination and
                    strategic thinking, allowing for rapid deployment and decisive action. Their profound respect for
                    the sea, a
                    reverence born from their very origins, allowed them to predict weather patterns, navigate
                    treacherous waters,
                    and anticipate the sea's challenges, solidifying their position as masters of the waves.

                    Internal Conflicts and External Expansion

                <p>
                    The Mechanikoi and Thaumaturgoi, though united in their goal of prosperity and protection, often
                    clashed in
                    their methods and philosophies. The Mechanikoi, driven by logic and practicality, sometimes viewed
                    the
                    Thaumaturgoi's reliance on intuition and emotion as a weakness. The Thaumaturgoi, in turn, accused
                    the
                    Mechanikoi of being cold and unfeeling, too focused on material gain and technological advancement.
                    These
                    internal tensions occasionally erupted into open conflict, leading to civil wars and the scarring of
                    their
                    island home. Ancient ruins and forgotten cities stood as silent testaments to these dark times.

                    For generations, the Mechanikoi and Thaumaturgoi had coexisted, their unique talents contributing to
                    the
                    prosperity of Thalassia. However, underlying tensions, fueled by differing philosophies and
                    ambitions, gradually
                    escalated. The Mechanikoi, driven by logic and efficiency, sought to harness the power of technology
                    to control
                    their environment and expand their influence. The Thaumaturgoi, attuned to the mystical energies of
                    the world,
                    believed in maintaining balance and harmony with nature, viewing the Mechanikoi's relentless pursuit
                    of progress
                    as reckless and destructive.
                </p>

                <p>
                    These ideological differences eventually erupted into open conflict, known as the Great Schism.
                    Battles raged
                    across Thalassia, pitting Mechanikoi war machines against Thaumaturgoi arcane spells. The conflict
                    reached its
                    climax at the coastal region that would later become known as the Shattered Coast.

                <h4>
                    The Final Stand
                </h4>

                <p>
                    Both factions recognized the strategic importance of this location. The Mechanikoi, with their
                    superior naval
                    power, sought to secure a foothold on the coast, establishing a staging point for their land-based
                    offensives.
                    The Thaumaturgoi, drawing upon the power of the sea, aimed to repel the Mechanikoi invasion and turn
                    the tide of
                    the war.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The battle was a cataclysmic clash of technology and magic. The Mechanikoi unleashed their most
                    advanced
                    weaponry: colossal siege engines that hurled explosive shells, automated war constructs that marched
                    relentlessly forward, and modified naval vessels that bombarded the coast with arcane-powered
                    cannons. The
                    Thaumaturgoi responded with devastating spells: summoning tidal waves that crashed against the
                    Mechanikoi fleet,
                    conjuring storms that ripped apart their airships, and unleashing arcane blasts that shattered their
                    war
                    machines.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The land itself became a battleground, scarred by the combined might of both factions. The earth
                    trembled as
                    Mechanikoi explosives tore apart the cliffs, and the sea boiled as Thaumaturgoi spells reshaped the
                    coastline.
                    The conflict reached a crescendo when a rogue Thaumaturgoi, in a desperate attempt to end the
                    battle, unleashed
                    a forbidden spell that shattered the very fabric of reality. The spell's backlash resulted in a
                    devastating
                    explosion that obliterated both armies and reshaped the coastline, leaving behind the jagged cliffs,
                    sunken
                    ruins, and lingering arcane energies that characterize the Shattered Coast today.

                <p>
                    The battle at the Shattered Coast marked the end of the Great Schism, but at a terrible cost. Both
                    the
                    Mechanikoi and Thaumaturgoi were left weakened and decimated, their once-proud armies reduced to
                    mere remnants.
                    The island of Thalassia bore the scars of the conflict, a grim reminder of the destructive power of
                    unchecked
                    ambition.

                <p>
                    Despite the devastation, the Thalassans eventually rebuilt their society, learning from the mistakes
                    of the
                    past. The Shattered Coast, though a symbol of their darkest hour, also became a testament to their
                    resilience.
                    The lingering arcane energies and the remnants of Mechanikoi technology served as a constant
                    reminder of the
                    delicate balance between progress and destruction, shaping the Thalassans' future and their approach

                <p>
                    The Thalassans' relentless pursuit of power and knowledge sometimes led them down dangerous paths.
                    They dabbled
                    in forbidden magic, experimented with dangerous technologies, and summoned entities from beyond.
                    These actions
                    had dire consequences, unleashing horrors that threatened to consume their world. While they
                    achieved great
                    things, they learned that the price of power was eternal vigilance, and the cost of complacency, the
                    downfall of
                    empires.

                    both ranged and close up weapons this alone solidifies them as a powerful force. The fauna there
                    also plays a huge part in their strength. By becoming a huge kingdom on taming they utilize animals
                    and creatures for power and connections. They all know how to use weapons so their forces are elite,
                    this was always the case even since the beginning of their existence. It started when a crew of
                    sailors that lived at sea found land, they previously lived on an island however a tsunami hit and
                    forced them to evacuate. When they reached the large area of land they camped out there, overtime
                    villages were built and eventually it became a city. Though it seems they weren't alone. Just across
                    from them were another city they would later name themselves Necria. Hundreds of years later Xeo
                    Dynasty was the name they brought upon.

                    As their territory grew interest in it did too, their neighbors Necria. Bloodshed, agonizing war and
                    violence, lasted for years as they fought for land. Countless deaths occurred, a massacre on both
                    sides even. The queen of Xeo Dynasty was a cruel dictator; she didn't care that her men died. After
                    much criticism she continued the clash, the results didn't change. Her soldiers blood stained on her
                    hands, her own people retaliate but her immense power put a quick stop.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The war went on for even more years, nothing changed, nothing was new. The people of Xeo Dynasty
                    were mad, they were in sorrow, they mourned over a lost family. Though one fortunate day the queen
                    was found dead, murdered on her own throne. She was beaten to death, but who could overthrow such a
                    foe? It was a sudden surprise, the one responsible was known as Oscar de Leon, in a world where most
                    have magical abilities it would come to a surprise that the one who brought the queen down had no
                    magical capabilities whatsoever. Through sheer will and determination Oscar made sure to bring her
                    down, thus the people named him king or emperor. Unlike many emperors, Oscar was kind to his people.
                    He was humble and generous, often taking requests and being a man of the people. He didn't see
                    himself higher than his people, in fact he walked among them in bare feet; he knew what it felt like
                    to grow up with nothing so royalty or status and fame meant nothing to him.

                <p>
                    After overthrowing the queen the next thing Oscar did was form an alliance with Necria, it had
                    seemed something similar went on with their ruler, both parties agreed an alliance would be best for
                    both kingdoms. In fact their truce would eventually turn into friendship and trades were happening,
                    a sudden turn had begun, one that was finally a positive result. Xeo Dynasty provided weapons and
                    tames, due to their location having redwood the strongest type of wood their wood was heavily
                    requested and became extremely valued this wasn't their only resource Necria wanted from them, in
                    fact they had many natural herbs and spices that they made delicious foods and antidotes.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Necrias supply of metal and magical armor was the main demand that Xeo Dynasty requested from them,
                    they benefited from each other and will continue to get stronger and more stable. To this day these
                    kingdoms have that unbreakable alliance, travels between citizens to each kingdom is very common due
                    to them being open with one another, overall peace was now justified and what was once a cruel and
                    dangerous situation between one another was now a calm and stable relationship as their alliance was
                    irreplaceable.

                    Xeo Dynasty now thrives with a substantial amount of resources including redwood, herbs, spices,
                    antibiotics, antidotes, and weapons. They were only missing metal and armor which they received from
                    Necria, though recently a gold mine was found in their kingdom, there was tons of it, an economic
                    miracle had been achieved. With this much gold the kingdom could afford thousands of homes for their
                    inhabitants, businesses were rising and their lifestyle had improved, they deserved this after
                    everything they had gone through it was time they had been treated well.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Thanks to all this gold that is still being mined to this day, Xeo Dynasty is able to purchase
                    resources and materials that they lack. They've even been able to implement a large educational
                    system so the people can learn more about everything. Knowledge was power and it was being
                    distributed to their people. Renovations were done and debts were paid, Xeo Dynasty was now
                    fulfilling their name, their defenses had drastically improved and their saddle production
                    increased. The emperor was proud of everyone's hard work. Other rare materials were also discovered
                    such as jade and rubies.

                <p>
                    The people of Xeo Dynasty are huge on agriculture, they had tons of farmers and many medicines due
                    to their wide abundance of crops and herbs that they use for medicinal purposes, they have many
                    cooks as the crops and food are vast in quantity and quality. The only job they really lack are
                    miners as there aren't many caves though they mainly go to Necria and help with the caves there, the
                    demand for blacksmiths is high as well, due to every citizen having possession of weapons, the
                    production of weapons is very high and the demand for blacksmiths has grown over the years many
                    wanting their weapons fixed or augmented. The kingdom is very safe, the people love the place and
                    very few crimes due to how elite the law enforcement units are.

                    There are many races that live in Xeo Dynasty the majority are humans and kitsunes, the first
                    agricultural revolution involved the bamboo shoots and redwood due it being the most common and most
                    abundant resource to harvest, it had seemed redwood trees would appear from nowhere it was a mystery
                    however Xeo Dynasty's ownership of the acres spreading throughout the redwood forest allowed for
                    them to benefit from the vast amount of redwood and thatch. This encouraged many people to carry
                    these resources and sell them under kingdom name.

                    Xeo Perks:
                </h3>

                <p>
                    Xeo perks are a form of perks one receives when they are born in Xeo Dynasty, there are 5 perks one
                    can obtain. Sometimes a rare case can occur and have one be born with two perks. These perks help
                    with certain statistics in one's physical or mental capabilities. Each perk has stages that
                    determine how much of an effect a perk has on said person; each rank up can be determined at the
                    scarlet tree of paradise by placing one's hand on the wood with permission from the kingdom; it will
                    show 4 letters each have a separate meaning. Ranking up perks takes a long time and threat levels
                    play a part in it too. The stronger one is the easier it is to rank up but even if one is strong it
                    can still take months or even years to rank up.
                </p>

                    <li>
                        D: This is the first letter everyone obtains at birth if they are born in Xeo Dynasty, it is the
                        first rank every perk starts off with the beginner perk it boosts said stat when a rank up
                        occurs, this perk doesn't really play much of a part as the rest though it is the beginning of
                        perks and introduces knowledge and understanding of said stat.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        O:This is the second letter one receives if they manage to rank up. It gives one a much more
                        clear understanding of said stat and the effect can actually be felt a little as it boosts said
                        stat by 10%, this plays a small part in threat level and can prove useful in certain situations.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        E:The third rank up, this is typically where most stop ranking up as ranking up from this letter
                        is almost extremely difficult due to how much it boosts said stat when one reaches this letter
                        their threat level is affected by a good margin boosting it by 20% this where the true use of
                        said perk comes into play.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        X:It is almost impossible to reach this letter without intense training and experience as this
                        perk boosts said stat by 40% this letter is almost never seen in a person the ones who do are
                        usually imperial guards or the strongest of code x. They can use this perk to their advantage
                        when needed.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Xeo:The true perk, it has all three letters and only one person holds this perk rank for the
                        perk emperor's blessing that being the Emperor, it boosts his stats by 100% playing an immense
                        amount of importance in his skills, he possesses two of the 4 perks and both are rank Xeo,
                        that's right if one was lucky enough to have 2 perks then they both would rank up separately one
                        could be a D while the other is an E. Though the emperor's two perks are both Xeo.

                </ol>

                <p>
                    Notice:If someone is fighting someone or competing against them and there is a difference in rank
                    ups the one with the higher rank will have an increased chance of winning depending on the gap, if
                    it is the same rank then it scales down on threat level or skill level aside from perks. Ex:Someone
                    with a rank O emperor's blessing will have a harder time reading their movements and facing them if
                    it is the same then the outcome would remain the same as if they had no perks to begin with. Also
                    perks are considered a passive as there is no process of activating it. Only the xeo rank for
                    emperor's blessing alone is the only one that only the emperor can have; the rest of the xeo rank
                    for the other perks can all be obtained by anyone if they work for it.

                    This perk improves one's ability to fight hand to hand combat, it gives them better knowledge and
                    understanding on hand to hand combat. This perk is usually unlocked when one has a natural interest
                    in hand to hand combat and uses it a lot. In order to progress towards a rank up one must use hand
                    to hand combat a lot such as on other people or on training dummies the most common people with this
                    perk usually are in the military branches.

                        to hand combat in this case, D rank emperor's blessing allows one to see movements slightly
                        better and have better control on their own as well.

                        their hand to hand combat and even better understanding of their own and others movements. Their
                        damage output is also greater as it gets boosted by 10% dealing a bit more damage than their
                        limit.

                        vicious battles to get here. Their understanding and analysis of hand to hand combat is off the
                        charts. Their damage output is increased from 10% to 20% this 20% extra damage will be available
                        so after the full limit of damage is done an extra 20% bonus will occur and stamina is also
                        increased by 10%. Even the best martial fighters wish they could achieve such a skill level.

                    and chemistry work. This is another situational perk though it too plays an important role for the

                        attack unless they are already aggroed. It also boosted tamed creatures' harvest rate by 15% and
                        improved their armor when having a saddle equipped by 5% more than what it usually is.

                <p>
                    The Xeo Dynasty has a large military, they all have advanced training and know how to wield several
                    weapons. There are 5 major branches in the military;
                </p>

                <h4>
                    The Army:
                </h4>

                <p>
                    The first branch is the main military or the Xeo Dynasty army, they are the frontlines of war, the
                    soldiers on foot. They wear heavy yet versatile armor made of a mixture between obsidian and metal.
                    They usually wield swords, spears,shields, bows, crossbows, maces, hammers, and they all are
                    equipped with daggers in case they lose their weapon. Some even ride horses with poison barbed
                    lances.
                </p>

                <h4>
                    Aerial Command:
                </h4>

                <p>
                    The aerial units are a unique force as they take the skies, usually surveying above Xeo Dynasty to
                    alert and then intercept a force if it were to approach the kingdom without notice through aerial
                    territory. They do this by riding domesticated creatures that can fly, the most common being
                    Argentavis and Rhynioganatha.
                </p>

                <h4>
                    Naval Forces:
                </h4>

                <p>
                    The seas are also important to the Xeo, they use it to fish and domesticate marine life. However
                    they also want to be prepared and the most common way of outsiders is through the sea, this means
                    they must intercept them to identify if they are a threat or not. They do this by creating large
                    ships and even domesticate large sea creatures that can carry their naval units.
                </p>

                    Code X are a group that make up the intelligence agency, they also take care of the dirty work done
                    in the shadows. They do the research on enemies and often play many roles such as spies, security,
                    the regular intelligence service, and covert operatives. They are one of Xeo Dynasty's most loyal
                    members as they do whatever it takes to make sure their kingdom and emperor are safe. They are the
                    intelligent of the five branches and all have different skills. They receive special weapons imbued
                    with magic upon signing the contract that states their loyalty to the emperor upon so they become
                    much stronger with these weapons however requirements are supposed to be met before one can sign the
                    contract such as serve 3 or more years in of the other four branches and have a clean background
                    once they pledge loyalty and sign the contract they can officially receive both their weapon and
                    training to become part of code X.

                    Imperial Guards are exactly what the name suggests, they guard the emperor and his palace, they also
                    assist army commanders in leading the army during battle if instructed by the emperor, they can
                    easily be identified by their red cape and long shuangyue. The armor they wear is also noticeable as
                    they wear both metal and obsidian along with gold, a gold much more dense than regular gold.they are
                    the hardest to defeat in battle and have the most intense training, they have the most skill and
                    most discipline. They dedicate themselves to protecting the emperor and his palace, however they
                    often get befriended by the emperor due to his kind nature.

                    The society used to be filled with depression and anxiety due to how cruel and selfish the past
                    queen was, she was practically a dictator. The government was a dictatorship and she was in charge,
                    this sorrow filled the air and many were distraught, they felt discord and fear of what was to come.
                    The people had no other choices besides fight or hide during the war against Necria however a
                    drastic change had occurred as the queen fell to a man who used his bare fists, the tides shifted
                    and war was over the newly appointed emperor has brought peace to Xeo which later became Xeo
                    Dynasty, he had agreed to come up with a peace treaty, officially declaring to have allied forces
                    with who they once considered enemies to allies.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Due to this change many were skeptical about it all at first but time has proven that the decision
                    had been a success, as everything started to get better for them, their economic system had boomed
                    after a gold mine discovery, more jobs had become available when Necria offered mining jobs, no more
                    war meant opportunity for life both civilian life and plant life which caused a huge increase in
                    agriculture. The fauna had begun to grow as well from what was once a charred desolate kingdom full
                    of civilians quivering through the vast prison of fear was now a flourishing kingdom springing with
                    life and fortitude, employment rates had increased and all five military branches had been
                    replenished. There are many jobs besides military ones now too which include agriculture, lumber,
                    mining, construction, alchemy, culinary, beast tamers, and many more. All the challenges the kingdom
                    faced were gone and now only thrive on success, all the challenges were gone and only goals
                    remained.

                    cherishes and protects. This tree is known as the scarlet tree of paradise, this is the largest
                    redwood tree reaching a whopping 1,000 meters in height being the tallest tree in the kingdom and
                    most likely the tallest tree in the world the craziest part is it is still growing, it is believed
                    to give life to other redwood trees and it continues to grow new ones explaining the huge numbers of
                    redwood trees. This forest is home to the majority of the Xeo Dynasty fauna and it's also home to
                    various groups of people who've built tree platforms having bridges connected to one another so they
                    don't have to be on land worrying about various predators.

                <h4>
                    Bamboo Jungle
                </h4>

                <p>
                    Their next geographical location is after finishing passing through the redwood forest is a bamboo
                    jungle this area has tons of bamboo and very easy to get lost in due to the green sight in the air,
                    this is where the majority of lakes and larger bodies of water are located while the rivers and
                    small ponds are in the redwood forest, here there are few homes each with paths to one another so
                    they cannot get lost, here is also where the majority of herbs are found usually ones for culinary
                    purposes and medicinal use there isn't as much predation here as the redwood forest but there is a
                    large variety of herbivores that call it home.

                <h4>
                    Caverns
                </h4>

                <p>
                    Here is where the drought of life appears, in the caves there is few animals found due to the odd
                    formation of rocks and crystals this not mean it is empty there are still creatures that inhabit the
                    caverns usually pose a threat to miners the crystals here also glow various colors and the large
                    mushrooms also glow it's also the only place mushrooms, crystal, obsidian, and gold can be found
                    however there is one cave in particular which is full of gold and gold alone besides the obvious
                    stone around it. These caves are usually only found in the redwood forest or the bamboo jungle.

                <h4>
                    Cherry Blossom Woods
                </h4>

                <p>
                    These woods are now scattered in between the kingdom many plant them near their homes as an
                    aesthetic appeal and there are very few oak trees in the kingdom so the majority is cherry blossom
                    trees. It's not really a wood but more part of the kingdom is very common, however there are larger
                    cherry blossom trees that are used as tree houses for apartments.

                <p>
                    Xeo City:The capital of the kingdom this is where the emperor's palace is located, it's the biggest
                    city in the kingdom and has the largest population. It is also located in the northern part of the
                    kingdom which is near the scarlet tree paradise securing its stability in case one was to try and
                    approach it. The reason it is so sacred and guarded is because it gives life to the redwood forests.
                    This city has tons of diversity and activity.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Crosswood:This is more of a village and it is located in the redwood forest, there are multiple of
                    these villages throughout different areas of the redwood forest, they are not on land but rather on
                    tree platforms connecting bridges to each tree to avoid the predation on the ground however even up
                    in the trees there can still be danger. This contains lots of tames and lumber work.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Siam:This is a small city located in the bamboo jungle, it is small and known for its large farms
                    and bamboo products, its main population believe it or not are kitsunes though they also share the
                    jungle with other races. There is also lots of fishing due to the abundance in the many bodies of
                    water.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Those are the major areas however there will be more added in the future and it does not include the
                    small or singular homes in different regions, just the ones with multiple.
