                    Any and all races should be capable of creating fertile offspring. Technically these are ‚ÄúRaces‚Äù
                    which means they all belong to one species, which in biology, the definition of ‚ÄúSpecies‚Äù is: ‚Äúa
                    category of living things that ranks below a genus, is made up of related individuals able to
                    produce fertile offspring, and is identified by a two-part scientific name.‚Äù
                </p>

                <p>
                    This means you can be as creative as you‚Äôd like and make hybrids if you so wish.

                <p>
                    Angels, the most kind and fair of the races. They are most known for being messengers of the
                    Gods due to the Gods being unable to do much themselves in the realm of mortals. They fight
                    demons, believing that they threaten the power of angels and are too sinful to be worth
                    anything. Angels are the only life Gods may create now, and they are only allowed to make ten at
                    a time due to the Gods‚Äô ‚ÄúAnti-Life Act‚Äù after the rules of Sensus were made. They are not
                    mindless, but they are to always follow the word of the God who summoned them, yet seem to go
                    out of their way to kill inherently evil races when they see them.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Angels are supposed to follow their God‚Äôs every whim. Especially the first ten angels. The first
                    ten a God makes are known as ‚ÄúSpecial Angels‚Äù and become fallen angels just by refusing the word
                    of their God. However, the kin of the first ten of a God are not forced to follow the word of a
                    deity, but also lack in the strength and magic of their parental figures.
                </p>

                <p>
                    They are most well known to be in the realm, Heaven. They usually are capable of telling whether
                    an individual of the neutral races is going to go once dead just by one glance. All of them
                    though are capable of flight and using a combination of holy and healing magic. Most angels are
                    different, having entirely different biology from one another unless the God that made them
                    intentionally similar. All angels can interbreed with one another.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Not much history is known about angels other than sometimes a God sends them to the mortal world
                    to help, kill, or any task their God asks of them truthfully.

                <p>
                    Fairies, known as the most beautiful creatures that don‚Äôt relate much to the Gods since their
                    creation. They are more often than not, really small, being around five to six inches tall on
                    average. Tallest fairy to ever exist, Corterer, was three foot tall, though it has said they
                    were part gnome, though that has yet to be proven. Fairies are more often than not being tricked
                    by their even smaller more mischievous counterpart, the pixies.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Fairies are most well known for healing and putting others to sleep. They are often at war
                    against the pixies due to their counterpart‚Äôs mischief. All fairies are capable of flying and
                    changing their size to make themselves taller, but they can always revert back to their standard
                    size. (5 feet tall max, 130 lbs at max weight.) The can also adjust‚Ä¶ other parts.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Most recent news of fairies is that they are in truth on the verge of extinction. They are not
                    made for combat like many other races, some are captured by other races, some are eaten by
                    goblins or trolls, their main predators, and others are bullied and sometimes killed by pixie
                    mischief. Those that survive are the strongest and wisest of their kind, natural selection
                    killing all but the best fairies.

                    Arachne
                </h2>

                    Created by <span class="discord-username">@ghoulishhopkins</span>
                </h3>

                <p>
                    Arachne are spider humanoids that are the
                    descendants of dark elves and dwarves, evolved
                    and traditionalized to be the highly intelligent
                    underground force of nature. Arachne were
                    created through their ancestors being trapped in
                    caves for millennia due to a dragon attack.
                    Luckily, they are able to shift into an even
                    more humanoid form, like Amphibian-Men.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Arachne are supernatural in strength,
                    durability, and agility. They all are capable of
                    creating webs that are stronger than duct tape
                    and they can walk on walls. Arachne are equipped
                    with venomous teeth and are immune to poison.
                    Arachne aren‚Äôt as well known as most of the
                    other races due to their extremely small
                    population, being only in Notoriety. Outsider
                    Arachne or traitors are hunted by Notoriety to
                    the point of them not existing, this is also to
                    make sure that angels don‚Äôt kill much of them,
                    as angels are known to not attack species/races
                    of low population.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Arachne have no regard for sentience, those who they let live are taken
                    and utilized for various purposes.
                    They are known to have a highly cannibalistic
                    nature and to be mostly carnivores. Arachne have
                    only been recently discovered, so much of this
                    is unknown to other races.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Arachne hierarchy is dictated through death
                    battles, if the king is killed then the killer
                    is now the king. They have a belief that they
                    most always follow the word of the powerful,

                <p>
                    The beastfolk are one of the more uncommon races to stumble across but they are still around. Their
                    exact origins are unknown but they;re believed to have come from animal magic in one way or another.
                    Some believe they come from a clan of mages that mixed themselves with animals for an experiment or
                    just to attempt to enhance their capabilities.
                </p>

                <p>
                    They are generally distinguished by: their fur in specific places, some of them have hooves but not
                    all, animal snouts (also not common), pretty much every example is unique from the last. Some are
                    more human-like and don't exert any special abilities while others are the exact opposite. Some
                    examples are: breathing underwater, short flight, night vision etc.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Their weaknesses are pretty much the same as those of average humans though due to their more
                    nomadic culture they are more susceptible to being very dependent and influenced by nature, by
                    things like droughts, floods, wildfires etc.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Male specimens are around 5‚Äô8 while females have an average stature of 5‚Äô2. Males weigh on average
                    175 lbs. While females around 156 lbs. They exert a very outgoing personality most of the time and
                    rarely are there specimens that would be considered introverts but of course there are some.
                    Generally they are very alike with normal humans.

                <p>
                    Changelings are a shapeshifting race, first found in the dark forest. There have been
                    numerous changeling propaganda, such as them stealing and replacing unprotected babies
                    with their own. However, this has only happened in a few cases. In truth, changelings
                    believe themselves to be morally right. They replace babies that have passed away
                    without being found by their parents yet to spare them from grief, it also spares the
                    changelings from responsibility, so they believe it to be a win-win.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Changelings are a quiet bunch that say nothing, though they can tell who and who isn‚Äôt
                    also a changeling. Due to their shape-shifting it is too hard to figure out their
                    history from others, being found in practically every kingdom. A changeling‚Äôs true forms
                    have pale skin, colorless eyes, and silvery white hair. Changelings have also been known
                    to be ‚Äúperfect assassins‚Äù. Their true form is revealed when touching gold.

                    Demons are malevolent supernatural entities
                    with many sub-races. Demons are inherently
                    evil or malevolent, seeking to cause harm
                    and suffering. They are often attributed
                    with supernatural powers, such as the
                    ability to possess humans. Their appearance
                    can vary greatly, from monstrous and
                    grotesque to more human-like or even
                    alluring. They might have horns, wings,
                    claws, or other non-human features. They are
                    incapable of dying from old age.

                <h4>
                    Fallen Angels:
                </h4>

                <p>
                    Fallen angels are essentially angels who, at
                    some point, chose to rebel against their God
                    (Which practically never happens). This
                    rebellion often stems from pride,
                    disobedience, or a desire for power. As a
                    result of their rebellion, they are cast out
                    of Heaven, losing their original state of
                    grace and becoming associated with evil or
                    darkness. The powers once gifted to them by
                    their God are taken away and replaced with
                    unholy abilities slightly weaker to what
                    they had. Fallen angels do not count as one
                    of the God‚Äôs angels anymore, allowing them
                    to create another.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Their motivations can vary, from a desire
                    for revenge against the Gods to a desire to
                    rule over their own domain or simply to sow
                    chaos and destruction. Their appearance can
                    also vary, from beautiful and alluring
                    (reflecting their angelic origins) to
                    monstrous and terrifying.

                    Personifications of Sin:
                </h4>

                <p>
                    Personifications of sin are the
                    representation of sins or vices as distinct
                    characters or figures, often with symbolic
                    appearances and behaviors. They have magic
                    usually relating to their sin. The
                    personifications of sin have a hierarchy of
                    their own where the Seven Deadly Sins are
                    above the Ten Mortal Sins, however, those

                <p>
                    The Seven Deadly Sins Include: Pride, Greed,

                    The Personifications of Sin are the only
                    rank of demons that angels and God‚Äôs refuse
                    to fight with, being that they are the
                    helpers of The God of the Afterlife, and
                    help set who goes to heaven or hell. The Ten
                    Mortal Sins make sure that mortals believe
                    in a God, and those who don‚Äôt are damned,
                    making them being the only demons the Gods

                    favored by the God of the Afterlife.

                    Archdevils:
                </h4>

                <p>
                    Archdevils are powerful, high-ranking devils
                    who rule over the leftovers of Hell that the
                    Personification of Sins didn‚Äôt want or care
                    to take for themselves. They represent the
                    epitome of evil, cunning, and tyranny.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Archdevils are masterful strategists and
                    manipulators, overseeing complex
                    bureaucracies and engaging in intricate
                    power struggles with each other. Each
                    archdevil typically possesses unique
                    abilities and domains of influence,
                    reflecting their individual personalities
                    and roles within the infernal hierarchy.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Archdevils are inherently evil beings,
                    embodying cruelty, corruption, and a desire
                    for domination. Archdevils usually have a
                    distinct appearance that reflects their
                    personality and domain. They might have
                    demonic features like horns, wings, or
                    claws, but often also possess a regal or
                    imposing presence.

                    The Sinners:
                </h4>

                <p>
                    Upon death, individuals who commit grave
                    sins or live a life of vice transform into
                    demonic beings. This transformation is seen
                    as a consequence of their actions and a
                    reflection of their inner corruption. This
                    transformation involves a loss of humanity,
                    with the sinner taking on demonic traits in
                    appearance, behavior, and nature, while
                    keeping or gaining traits that are related
                    to their life and death. They gain abilities
                    related to their death and life as well,
                    putting them above the hellborn.
                </p>

                    This includes imps, hellhounds, and
                    succubi/incubi. They are fundamentally weak
                    compared to any other demon sub-race. These
                    creatures however do have the potential to
                    become archdevils, however it‚Äôs extremely

                    Dragonfolk, the tamed dragons that counter their feral counterparts. Dragonfolk
                    start as feral dragons at birth, however, when they are tamed they gain sentience
                    and a bond to their trainer. After their trainer dies (if their trainer isn‚Äôt a
                    parent) they have gained all this knowledge and become one of what is now known as
                    the dragonfolk. There are many kinds of dragonfolk, one of every kind of species,
                    all of which capable of making a human form once tamed.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Dragonfolk are a powerful race, born with strong magic. Due to them being basically
                    at the top of the food chain, there are less of them than humans, but still more or
                    less common. Most common dragonfolk are capable of being killed by skillful humans
                    or other races, but it all really just depends. Most dragonfolk have lost the
                    ability to transform into a pure dragon if they were conceived in human form. It is
                    now extremely rare for dragonfolk to be capable of turning into a powerful dragon.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Dragonfolk and the Arachne are each other's nemesis. Dragons were the root that
                    created the Arachne when they attacked a kingdom of Dwarves. The dwarves ran to the
                    mines, filled with a stronger amount of magic. Once the cave system was destroyed by
                    the dragons all remaining dwarves were stuck in the shafts. They evolved into
                    Arachne a millennia later.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Dragonfolk always resemble their dragon form, where it‚Äôs the scales on their human
                    form, some mark, or some other obvious feature. It all differs from dragon to
                    dragon. To figure out more on dragons read species lore.

                    Dwarves, a race with the hands of a craftsman yet the stubbornness of a donkey.
                    It is said dwarves tend to handle their booze ten times better than any other,
                    and sometimes even work better while drunk. Dwarves amass metals and any who
                    have been trained can tell the quality of the work or material with a simple
                    look over.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Dwarves are smaller and broader than humans, standing at around four to five
                    feet tall. They are obviously on the smaller side. Dwarves seem to have an
                    easier time mining, having the easiest time finding good enough materials to
                    craft with. Dwarves have also been known for their racism against Elves and vice
                    versa, starting fights and wars against them.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Dwarves are cut into ‚Äúsub-races,‚Äù though there aren‚Äôt many physical differences.
                    Saying ‚ÄúDwarf‚Äù as your character‚Äôs race is probably good enough for us to know

                    Elves, one of the more agile and charming races. Elves have been seen as
                    light-hearted, kind, etc. Though that is extremely stereotypical and will
                    likely get you punched in the throat. Elves are known to be a beautiful,
                    human-sized race. They are graceful, yet frail, being naturally slender.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The most well known trait of the elves, their pointed ears, disgust the most
                    racist dwarves. Elves have gone against dwarves many times in the past,
                    though it had normally ended in stalemate. They call truce on eachother,
                    believing it to be a waste of time for both sides due to them not being able
                    to break through either side or gain an advantage.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Elves usually possess quickly passing passions, and being easy to manipulate
                    their emotions. All elves have longevity, living far longer than any other
                    race besides Demons or Angels. Elves are capable of sharing history like no
                    other race, being able to bring knowledge to each generation.

                    Elf Sub-Races:
                </h3>

                <p>
                    Elves are known to have many subraces, each being extremely different from
                    the other. Sometimes it is questionable if they are considered a race of
                    their own.
                </p>

                </h4>

                <p>
                    Commonly called the most evil of all Elf subraces, discriminated against
                    even by other elves. They are known to be rather primitive, having dark
                    brown skin and black hair. Dark Elves have a history of supporting Demon
                    Lords and Gods that have questionable morals.

                <p>
                    Also called Silver Elves or Gray Elves, these are the most common of elven
                    races. These elves are rather tall, standing around human height, if not
                    just a tad bit more. Their skin is pale with an icy blue hue. Their eyes are
                    most commonly green or blue.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Moon Elves are the most impulsive and more likely to act on emotions. They
                    have a strong distaste for complacency or isolation. Moon elves enjoy
                    travel, exploring the wilderness for what it is. Due to them usually being
                    extroverted they tend to make friendships rather easily.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Few Moon Elves stay in one place for long, they prefer to always be moving.
                    There are no kingdoms specifically ruled by moon elves due to this, as they
                    care too much for adventure to give it up.

                    many fantasy settings. They are often depicted as wise, powerful, and aloof,
                    with a strong connection to magic and the sun.

                    hair, and eyes that can be blue, green, or gold. Some Sun Elves have skin
                    that shimmers with a faint golden light.

                    a deep appreciation for art, music, and literature. They are also skilled in
                    magic and warfare, and are often seen as leaders among the elves. Sun Elves
                    are often aloof and disdainful of other races, whom they consider to be less
                    civilized.

                    enjoying practical jokes, though these
                    pranks can sometimes be harmful or
                    destructive. In many settings, goblins
                    are depicted as cowardly and likely to
                    flee from danger unless they have a
                    significant advantage. While often
                    chaotic, some portrayals of goblins
                    emphasize their industriousness and
                    skill in crafting or engineering, albeit
                    often with shoddy or unpredictable
                    results.

                    Halflings are small, typically around 3 feet tall, making them
                    significantly shorter than humans. Despite their height, they are
                    proportioned like smaller humans, not like children. A distinctive
                    feature is their hairy feet, which are often tough and leathery,
                    allowing them to go without shoes. They tend to have round, cheerful
                    faces and often have a youthful appearance even in old age.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Halflings are known for their love of good food, good company, and a
                    comfortable home. They value peace and quiet and are generally
                    content with simple pleasures. While they love their homes, many
                    halflings also possess a strong sense of curiosity and a desire to
                    explore the world. This leads some to take up adventurous lives.
                    Halflings are generally practical and down-to-earth. They are not
                    prone to grand ambitions or flights of fancy. They are typically
                    good-natured and friendly, though they can be fierce when their
                    friends or homes are threatened.

                    Abilities: All Kitsune‚Äôs possess the following:
                </h4>

                <p>
                    Magic Affinity
                </p>

                <p>
                    Transformation (Fox Form)
                </p>

                <p>
                    Longevity
                </p>

                <p>
                    Some develop further powers, though the older and more plentiful the tails of a Kitsune, the more
                    likely they are to develop such abilities. Their magic usually involves trickery, illusion or
                    otherwise bewitching people. Only particularly old Kitsune‚Äôs tend to develop any sort of psychic,
                    elemental or destructive magics.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Weaknesses: Can be mortally wounded, and are more fond of mischief than outright malevolence. They
                    can be tricked themselves, have a weak spot for shiny things and deals which seem interesting, and
                    aren‚Äôt known for brute strength, relying on trickery and leveling playing fields.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Race/Species Build: Between 5‚Äô5-6‚Äô5, they tend to be tall and slender, but their size can range,
                    just like humans. They are stronger, and more agile than a human- But don‚Äôt boast supernatural
                    strength or speed. They usually have fox-like features, even in human form- Either markings or
                    cat-like eyes that give them away, if the ears and tail/tails weren‚Äôt obvious enough.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Average Personality: Mischievous, all Kitsune‚Äôs have an innate desire to gather knowledge. They are
                    prone to moodiness, tend to hold grudges and are known for both their tendency to both trick, and
                    help people. They don‚Äôt have political or racial qualms with anyone, though ironically they don‚Äôt
                    seem to enjoy other Kitsune‚Äôs presence.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Race/Species History: Some say Kitsune‚Äôs were born as messengers from a dead God, while others
                    simply believe them a distant relative of Beastkin. Whatever the belief- They are one of the first
                    races to settle the mountain ranges of Kimowara. Not known for settling- They‚Äôve been wanderers
                    since the early days, and tend to find other Kitsunes competitors. Thus, despite their nomadic
                    nature- They aren‚Äôt known to gather or travel together.

                    Kobolds. The small cold-blooded, scaly, reptile beings. Kobolds are very interesting creatures other
                    than being cute or mischievous. Kobolds are also pretty similar compared to goblins. There are many
                    different types of kobolds but we'll keep to the basics of what they are, look like, what they eat,
                    like, and ect.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Kobolds like many things. Hunting, gold and jewelry/gems, music, etc but there's plenty of things
                    they hate. One of those things being made fun of because of their height. Another thing kobolds
                    absolutely hate are goblins. Kobolds and goblins generally do not get along, often viewing each
                    other as competition for territory and resources, with goblins usually considered the dominant
                    force, potentially even bullying or subjugating kobolds due to their smaller size. Both races often
                    inhabit similar environments like caves or underground areas, leading to conflict over territory.
                    Goblins are usually seen as stronger and more aggressive, potentially leading them to exploit or
                    even enslaving kobolds.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Just and almost like most beings, they are capable of using magic or just fire in general like
                    dragons. So yeah, they can breathe fire and can probably manipulate other elements like ice or
                    lightning. Kobolds are also naturally flexible and quick on their legs. They have pretty good senses
                    that would even be better than an elves. They can sometimes be naturally a fighter too.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Kobolds can differ in height. Most kobolds you'd meet or see would most likely be 4 down to 3 feet.
                    They are more like mini dragons
                </p>

                <p>
                    Kobolds are omnivorous and eat a variety of plants and animals, but they will eat almost anything
                    when they're desperate like bones and bark. Since Kobolds are cold-blooded, they don't need to eat
                    for days if they've been in a warm place.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Kobolds typically live in caves or underground like some goblins but you could also find them in
                    many places as well like forest, towns, and other places.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Kobolds can live for about 100+ years (120 max). Kobolds, just like goblins are known to be able to
                    mate with literally anything, especially the females. The female's body can sorta, fit their mate if
                    that makes sense. They can lay multiple eggs and are very fertile so be warned. Kobolds also have
                    the biggest birth rate compared to other races. An even bigger warning would be mating season üíÄand
                    for them that's around spring and summer time, just depends. Both males and females can go into heat
                    and can get pretty aggressive towards their mate especially if you don't give them what they want.
                    They may nibble you or just be very clingy and annoying so your best options would be to ignore them
                    and let it pass or give them what they want. Now, kobolds can and will mate outside of mating season
                    as well with their mates. Male kobolds can sometimes either have slits like a female's vagina and
                    have their genitals and all that on the inside OR sometimes they will have their balls out like a
                    humans or beastkin. They also have pretty long tongues
                </p>

                <p>
                    Before our last topic, kobolds are very intelligent and creative creatures unlike dumb goblins.
                    Kobolds know many skills like how to cook, do chores so they make better maids, they know how to
                    hunt, how to heal someone with herbs, they also understand other languages easily, and some are born
                    warriors no matter if they are male or female. The females are also great mothers and very caring.

                    Originating from rituals developed by those investigating magic beyond death, the Malachim are tied
                    to magic of the afterlife. By undergoing rituals that aren't always successful, people can try for a
                    small chance to become a Malachim. The Malachim vary widely, from those who just have wings, to
                    those who are known as "Lightbringer Malachim" the pure form with wings, a halo, and strong magic
                    granted to them. However, they are unable to be resurrected or come back to life after death, having
                    channeled post-mortal power in life.

                    Orcs are generally humanoid in shape, though often larger

                    prominent tusks or fangs and green or greenish-grey skin
                    with few exceptions. They are given brutish features, such
                    as sloping foreheads, heavy brows, and wide noses,
                    emphasizing their aggressive nature. Orcs are seen as less
                    intelligent due to their often outbursts of aggression and
                    lack of education.

                    Orcs are frequently depicted as inherently violent and

                    They often live in tribal societies with strong hierarchies

                    Pixies are typically depicted as
                    tiny humanoids, often only a few
                    millimeters tall. They usually have
                    delicate, insect-like wings,

                    feature is their pointed ears,
                    similar to those of elves. Pixies
                    often have a childlike or youthful
                    appearance, with bright eyes and
                    cheerful expressions.

                    associated with forests, meadows,

                    are often shy and elusive,

                    themselves through the misfortune of
                    others. Pixies are the rivals of
                    fairies, willing to dismember them

                <p>
                    Tieflings are fundamentally humanoid, sharing a similar
                    build and stature with humans. Their most distinctive
                    traits are a result of their infernal ancestry, which
                    can manifest in various ways:
                </p>

                <p>
                    Horns: These can vary in shape and size, from small and
                    subtle to large and dramatic, resembling those of rams,
                    goats, or other horned creatures.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Tail: A prehensile tail, usually around 4 to 5 feet
                    long.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Eyes: Often solid colors like red, black, white, silver,
                    or gold, lacking a visible pupil.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Skin Tone: While some tieflings have human-like skin
                    tones, many exhibit reddish hues, ranging from deep
                    crimson to subtle russet.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Other Features: Other possible traits include pointed
                    teeth, a faint scent of sulfur, or subtle scales.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Tieflings often grapple with their infernal heritage,
                    leading to internal conflicts and a strong sense of
                    independence. They tend to be naturally charismatic and
                    persuasive, sometimes bordering on manipulative. Due to
                    their ancestry, tieflings often face prejudice and
                    mistrust from other races. Despite their infernal
                    connection, tieflings are not inherently evil. They can
                    be of any alignment, choosing their own path in life.

                    The story of amphibian men started at the birth of Mwura. The God wanted a populous that
                    shared the same love and affection for water as they did. As such, from the water, Mwura
                    raised an island, Arora, with men and women that consider themselves the descendants of
                    water itself. Amphibian men are excellent inhabitants of the water, often capturing and
                    selling overpopulated species of the sea.

                    They are split between two classes, deformed and standard. Standard class are known for
                    being in the shallow parts of the sea, mainly around their mainland, while the deformed
                    class look stronger and more like a monster due to being evolved to handle the bottom of the
                    ocean. Despite their huge differences they see each other as equals even though there are
                    far more of the standard class. Deformed class are known to be stronger than orcs, faster as
                    well. They tend to have a shorter life span though. Every triton has the ability to change
                    their look to seem more human.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Their history has been enshrouded from lies at the very beginning by the first of the
                    amphibian-men, proclaiming themselves as king after ‚Äúcreating‚Äù the necklace that was able to
                    control every body of water in the world. However, this was not true, the necklace came from
                    divine origin, specifically due to the defeat of Mwura. Sensus through Mwura‚Äôs soul weapon
